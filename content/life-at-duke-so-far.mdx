I'm currently wrapping up my first semester at Duke University, where working on my Master of Engineering (MEng) in Artificial Intelligence degree.
The courses that I'm taking have been tremendously useful, covering fundamentals of sourcing data, ML modeling, career strategy, and business.
I'm creating this personal portfolio as an assignment for one of my classes, which I'm really grateful for because it's giving me the opportunity
to learn a bit of Next.js while also helping to strengthen my online presence as a software engineer and prospective AI/ML engineer.

I'm additionally thankful for the opportunities that I've had to work on exciting and challenging projects with a cohort of brilliant students (many of whom have become really good friends), 
under the guidance of professors who are all passionate about the subjects that they teach and clearly committed to seeing that we're successful.
